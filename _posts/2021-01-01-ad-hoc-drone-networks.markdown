Research Project with Dr. Sarang Dhongdi at BITS Pilani, Goa. We built a framework for the analysis of ad-hoc networks of aerial vehicles under constrained mobility conditions. This work was developed for robust and reliable exploration of disaster prone areas by teams of aerial vehicles. The framework used NS3 and ROS, and we further emulated the network on Intel boards that can be mounted on real drones.
