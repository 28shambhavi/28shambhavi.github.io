We present a hierarchical approach that first finds a sequence of tasks to complete a goal, then identifies ordering constraints between tasks and parallelizes it for multiple agents, and finally computes collision-free paths for multiple robots to perform said actions. We present this approach to solve the multi-agent collective construction problem, where homogeneous robots must assemble a modular structure. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvement in the solution computation time of tested structures, and further make larger and more complex structures tractable.
