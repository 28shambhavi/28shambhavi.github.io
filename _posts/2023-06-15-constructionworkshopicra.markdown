Given a modular structure and a set of homogeneous robots that can pick-up and place blocks, we aim to task the robots to collectively construct the structure. To this end, we develop a hierarchical planner that employs temporal logic to first plan at the task-level, then parallelizes the task-level plan for multiple agents, and finally finds paths for agents to execute the tasks.
